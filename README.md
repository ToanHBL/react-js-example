# How to run the project
To run this example:

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`



# Interview Assessment

### 1. Explain the Project Structure
**Tasks:**
1. Describe the purpose of the project.  
2. Explain how React Query works in this project.  

---

### 2. Current Implementation in `index.tsx`
Right now, all of the code is implemented directly inside `index.tsx`.  

**Tasks:**  
1. Refactor the project by restructuring it using the knowledge you have.  
2. Explain why you chose that structure and how it improves efficiency.  

---

### 3. Migrating from JSONPlaceholder
Currently, the project fetches data from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts).  

**Tasks:**  
1. Remove the dependency on JSONPlaceholder.  
2. Replace it with a mock API inside your frontend project so that the app no longer makes requests to external services.  
3. Ensure the project still has working data. Later, we will integrate with the actual backend API service.
